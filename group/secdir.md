The [Security Area Directorate](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/secdir/about/) provides support to the IETF Security Area Directors. The group consists of the Working Group Chairs of the Security Area and selected individuals chosen for their technical knowledge in security and their willingness to work with other groups within the IETF to help provide security throughout IETF protocols.

The security directorate is currently reviewing all IETF documents that pass through the IESG as a way to help the security area directors improve their efficiency. More information about the [Security Directorate Review Process](SecDirReview).

For a list of the current directorate members, see the [list of subscribers to the secdir mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/roster/secdir).

The directorate can be contacted by sending e-mail to secdir@ietf.org.  The list archives are available at http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/secdir/current/maillist.html.
