# GEOPRIV implementations 
We try to maintain a list of software tools that implement the GEOPRIV protocols: [GeoprivTools](/group/geopriv/GeoprivTools).

## Virtual Interim, November 2010
The GEOPRIV WG will have a virtual interim meeting (i.e., a teleconference) on November 30, 2010. Information about the call can be found on this page: [VirtualInterimNov2010](/group/geopriv/VirtualInterimNov2010).

## Virtual Interim, September 2009
The GEOPRIV WG will have a virtual interim meeting (i.e., a teleconference) on September 15, 2009. Information about the call can be found on this page: [VirtualInterimSept2009](/group/geopriv/VirtualInterimSept2009).

## IEEE Liaison
On 20 July 2009, the GEOPRIV chairs received a liaison statement from the IEEE 802.11 WG regarding binary location formats. The liaison statement is attached to this page as 11-09-0718-01-000v-liaison-request-to-ietf-geopriv.doc .

## [RFC 3825](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3825) Update
One major work item for GEOPRIV right now is implementing a set of updates to [RFC 3825](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3825). In order to keep track of the updates we're making, we're using trac with an RFC3825UpdateProcess?.

## Virtual Interim, May 2009
The GEOPRIV WG had a virtual interim meeting (i.e., a teleconference) on May 21, 2009. Information about that call can be found on this page: [VirtualInterimMay2009](/group/geopriv/VirtualInterimMay2009) Slides are attached to this page, for historical reasons.

## Location Formats
GEOPRIV are collecting information on [LocationFormats](/group/geopriv/LocationFormats) used in different standards bodies and specifications.

## Location Coherence
[Bar BoF at IETF 77 on Location Coherence (LoCo)](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/geopriv/current/msg08377.html), which is basically focused on interoperability among different location protocols and APIs. Slides are attached.
