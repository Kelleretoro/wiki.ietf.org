# Transport Area WG (TSVWG)

The Transport and Services WG works on mechanisms related to end-to-end data transport to support Internet applications and services that exchange potentially large volumes of traffic at potentially high bandwidths. The scope includes protcol mechanisms for Internet transport control protocols such as TCP, QUIC, SCTP, MPTCP, and DCCP. The group maintains the SCTP, and DCCP protocols. This develops specifications for endpoint to network control mechanisms, Diffserv, QoS and reservation signaling, extensions to existing transport protocols (when not protocol-specific), and extensions to the IETF protocols to support transport protocols (e.g., ECN).

The TSVWG receives occasional proposals for the development and publication of RFCs dealing with transport topics that are not in scope of an existing working group (e.g., NAT) and that does not justify the formation of a new working group. This working group provides a venue to progress such documents.

It is important to differentiate [TSVWG](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tsvwg/documents/), which is a document-producing working group, from WITAREA, which is the area-wide meeting that the transport area regularly holds during IETF meetings. WITAREA does not produce any documents, and its purpose is to expose new developments related to web and Internet transport topics to the community.
