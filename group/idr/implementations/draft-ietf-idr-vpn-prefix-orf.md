# Implementation Report for draft-ietf-idr-vpn-prefix-orf 


## Vendor or Open Source Implementations 

H3C has implemented some VPN Prefix ORF mechanism related functions as follows:
- By configuring VRF Prefix limit and quota, achieve the use of RD and Source PE to control VPN routing. 
- Generating, transmitting and processing Type 1 and Type 2 Source PE TLV.	
- Using the Offending VPN routes process method to revoke all routes.	
 		
We also implemented the following functions based on the open-source BGP implementation (FRR):	
- VPN Prefix ORF mechanism triggered based on VRF limit in intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios.	
- RD based VPN routing filtering in intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios.
