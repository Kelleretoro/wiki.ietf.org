N1(Note 1):  The Huawei VRP implementation uses the (Use the Color EC with the largest value). 

## interoperability test results 
Interoperability tests between various vendors for this specification has been tested by EANTC for several years now. Specifically, please refer to this test report from the 2019 event
[ENACTC test report](https://eantc.de/fileadmin/eantc/downloads/News/2019/EANTC-MPLSSDNNFV2019-WhitePaper-v1.2.pdf).  

- The BGP SR Policy SAFI usage for signaling between controller & routers was tested.  Also the steering based on Color Extended Community.  Refer to pages 26-27

Additional tests were done in similar events in [2020](https://eantc.de/fileadmin/eantc/downloads/events/MPLS2020/EANTC-MPLSSDNNFV2020-WhitePaper.pdf) and [2022](https://eantc.de/fileadmin/eantc/downloads/events/2022/EANTC-InteropTest2022-TestReport.pdf). 
 
 The interoperability tests do not cover the error conditions or the handing of malformed/invalid BGP
 UPDATE messages.
