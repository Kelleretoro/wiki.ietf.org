# Shepherd Reviews for draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp (draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp)

## Summary 
**draft:**  [draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp)
**renamed draft**: draft-ietf-idr-bgp-sr-mpls-elp
**Type:** Proposed Standard 
**status:** WG Draft  
**adopted:**  8/12/2024 (7/12/2024 - 7/30/2024) 
**current version:** 02
**Early Allocation**: yes, but need to revised draft first 
**implementations:** H3C and ZTE (2 implementations) 
**bgp-ls draft:** none


## Review of -03 
**draft:** [draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp-03](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp-03)
**Status**: resolves previous technical issues, minor editorial nits for follow-up on Issue 2. 
Next step:  2 implementations required for WG LC 


### Technical issues resolved 
- Review-1, Issue #1: resolved in version 3 
- Review-1, Issue #2: Section 4 or 5, Missing Error handling for a malformed Explicit NULL Policy TLV - needs textual edit: 

Current 
>   The error handling principles for the SR Policy TLVs/sub-TLVs in
>    [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] apply to this document.  The validation
>    of each ELP sub-TLV MUST be performed on the headend nodes to
>    determine if they are malformed or invalid.  In case of any error
>    detected, the "treat-as-withdraw" strategy MUST be applied.

Suggested changes:
>    The error handling methods for the SR Policy TLVs/sub-TLVs in
>    [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] apply to this document.  The validation
>    of each ELP sub-TLV MUST be performed in headend nodes in the BGP 
>    process to determine if they are malformed or invalid.  In case of any error
>    detected, the "treat-as-withdraw" strategy MUST be applied.
>    
>    The SRPM policy determines if the values for ELP impact the
>    selection of the SR Policy Candidate Path (SR Policy CP) as the best SR Policy CP.

- Review 1, Issue #3 -  Security Section,Resolved with following text in -03 

>    The ELP extension is included in the SR Policy extension
>    [I-D.ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi], so it does not introduce extra
>    security problems comparing the existing SR policy entension.  SR
>    Policies with ELP information distributed by BGP are expected to be
>    used entirely within trusted SR domain.  The ELP information is a
>    critical piece of information about critical infrastructure.
>    Therefore, precaution is necessary to ensure that the ELP information
>    advertised via BGP sessions is limited to nodes in a secure manner
>    within this trusted SR domain.

- Issue #4 - Missing Scalability considerations for this work. 

Resolved with the following comments in section 4, last paragraph: 

    When using the protocol extensions introduced in this document,
   scalability SHOULD be considered since it may increase the the amount
   of control plane information(i.e., the BGP messages) exchanged
   between the network controller and the headend nodes.

### Shepherd Question

#### Question:  Is this draft no longer needed since Entropyy La added to [draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi]
 
#### Answer from Yao 
> Section 2.4.5 in draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi defines a Explicit NULL Label Policy Sub-TLV to indicate whether and how to push a Explicit NULL Label(ENLP) on the packet when steering that packet into SR Policy. And this ENLP Sub-TLV MUST NOT appear more than once.
> 
> As in RFC4182, the Explicit NULL Label(ENLP) has only two values, value of 0 for the "IPv4 Explicit NULL Label", value of 2 for the "IPv6 Explicit NULL Label". When ENLP appear in the top of label stack, it indicates that the label stack must be popped.
> 
> While draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp defines  ELP(Entropy Label Position) sub-TLV to indicate the Entropy Label Position in the SID List. Entropy Label is used for load balancing purpose, it may appear multiple times in the segment list and the value of EL is supplemented by the ingress node.
> 
> Considering that the definition, usage for SR and position in the label stack are different for Explicit NULL Label and Entropy Label,  the content in draft-ietf-idr-bgp-srmpls-elp can not be cover by draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi section 2.4.5.

### Technical Issue in -01  

#### Issue-1:  Section 3, paragraph starting "For example". BGP-LS reference

Should the BGP-LS reference be [RFC9085][RFC9552] or just [RFC9552]? 


#### Issue-2. Missing Error handling for a malformed Explicit NULL Policy TLV 

See [draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi] for example handling.  A short section is necessary 
to remind the user what error error handling (ignore if malformed, or 
treat as withdraw) is appropriate fort his the Explicti Null Policy TLV. 

#### Issue-3: Security Section, Please enhance the security section 
Security section should refer to security section in 
[draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi]. It is important to reference:

a) operates in trusted environment (as draft-ietf-idr-sr-policy-safi)
b) Operators must a NRP-ID for one or more SR Policy is a critical piece of 
information about critical infrastructure.  Care must be take 
with distribution of information.   
   
  
#### Issue-4 Section 4, Scalability Considerations. 

Old text:/ When BGP is
   used for distributing SR Policy candidate paths, the amount of
   control plane information exchanged between the network controller
   and the headend nodes would also increase. This increases comes in 
   routes (BGP NLRI and BGP attribute combinations). / 
   
 Both the NLRI growth and the attribute growth should be flagged in the text.
