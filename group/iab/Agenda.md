## Regrets




## Topics for Future Informal Meetings

- (August 27?) RSS-GWG Liaison Report, [ICANN Public Comment](https://www.icann.org/en/public-comment/proceeding/functional-model-for-root-server-system-governance-11-08-2025)
- At every IETF meeting can we reserve one slot (Sunday or breakfast meeting) for ISOC? Reasoning: Of course we can always explicitly ask ISOC to report on a specific topic but if we have a fixed slot reserved and ask them to propose a topic, I think that would give us some additional interesting insight and could also help to have some continuity in information exchange and build relations with different people from ISOC.
