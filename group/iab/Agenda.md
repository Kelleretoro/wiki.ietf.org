## Topics for Future Informal Meetings

- August 27 (formal meeting time): Talk with ISE (Eliot Lear)
- Can/should we have the liaison social hour on a yearly basis? (Liaison Coordinators)
- Let's invite the ICANN board liaison also at least once a year to an IAB breakfast (Liaison Coordinators)
- Handling of ITU-T Standards Landscape database (see https://github.com/intarchboard/responsibilities/issues/68) (Liaison Coordinators)
- At every IETF meeting can we reserve one slot (Sunday or breakfast meeting) for ISOC? Reasoning: Of course we can always explicitly ask ISOC to report on a specific topic but if we have a fixed slot reserved and ask them to propose a topic, I think that would give us some additional interesting insight and could also help to have some continuity in information exchange and build relations with different people from ISOC.
