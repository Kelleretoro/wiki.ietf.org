# DOTS Working Group

The aim of [DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dots/about/) is to develop a standards based approach for the realtime signaling of DDoS related telemetry and threat handling requests and data between elements concerned with DDoS attack detection, classification, traceback, and mitigation.

## DOTS in GitHub 
The working group authors use the [dotswg](https://github.com/dotswg/) project in [github](https://github.com/ ) for working versions of the documents and to track issues.  Each document uses a distinct repository.

* [draft-ietf-dots-requirements](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-requirements) ([Issues](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-requirements/issues))
* [draft-ietf-dots-use-cases](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-use-cases) ([Issues](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-use-cases/issues))
* [draft-ietf-dots-architecture](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-architecture) ([Issues](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-architecture/issues))
* [draft-ietf-dots-signal-channel](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-signal-channel) ([Issues](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-signal-channel/issues))
* [draft-ietf-dots-data-channel](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-data-channel) ([Issues](https://github.com/dotswg/dots-data-channel/issues))
