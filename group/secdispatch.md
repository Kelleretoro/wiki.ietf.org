# Secdispatch Wiki 
*Guidelines for effective participation in the Secdispatch working group*

## Starting Points
Make sure to read the [charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/secdispatch/about/) and join the [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/secdispatch). You can also browse the [mailing list archives](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/secdispatch/).

## The DISPATCH Process
**Ground Rules**

- Secdispatch recommends next steps for new work
- Secdispatch DOES NOT adopt drafts

**Possible Outcomes of Meeting**

- Direct to an existing WG
- Propose a new, focused WG
- AD-sponsorship (assuming AD is willing)
- Additional discussion or community development required (e.g., with a new non-WG mailing list)
- IETF should not work on this topic

## Requesting Time on the Agenda
As face-to-face time is very valuable, it's important to prepare for it. It is recommended to start a thread in the mailing list introducing the topic you'd like to present. Helpful items to include in the first mail (or mail thread) are:

1. pointers to a draft(s)
2. pointers to ongoing/prior discussions
3. pointers to implementations
4. pointers to any other background materials
5. summarizing prior engagement with existing WGs
6. summarizing who would want to advance this work
7. desired next steps
8. desired time for discussion

When requesting agenda time, please also CC the chairs.

The chairs will consider the points above and any deriving discussions when setting up the agenda. Also, keep these in mind when preparing your presentation!

Note that precedence in the meeting will be given to documents that have demonstrated interest in the form of active drafts and mailing list discussion, as well as presenters who submit slides according to the timeline. The chairs reserve the right to remove presentations from the agenda if slides are not sent in on time.

## Preparing your slides
When preparing your slides, try to include point 1 to 7 above. The presentation should cover motivation, background and hoped dispatching outcome (see above).

Please consider using the SecDispatch template ([.odp](secdispatch/secdispatch-template.odp) or [.pptx](secdispatch/secdispatch-template.pptx) formats available) to build your slide deck.

We suggest the slides to be clear and concise: the discussion after the presentation is often more interesting both for the presenters and for us chairs to gauge interest and dispatch the work successfully. An ideal split for a 20 min slot would be 10 min presentation + 10 min discussion. In general, if possible, try to keep more than half time for discussion. People in the working group are expected to have read the draft before the meeting.

Please remember to put page numbers on your slides!

## Good to Think About
- Because of the dispatch nature of the working group, participants in secdispatch mail threads might not be subscribed to the mailing list. Think about keeping people you are addressing in the To: field, if you want to make sure they see your email.
- Send your slides on time!
- starting a thread in the mailing list is great; "advertising" your work to possible interested parties and get them to provide feedback in the mail thread and participate in the meeting is even better to help the chairs dispatch your work.
