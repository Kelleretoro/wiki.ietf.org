# Design Philosophy
PCP design philosophy is best captured in [Stuart Cheshire's slides](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/79/slides/pcp-5.pdf) from IETF79 (Beijing).

# Why isn't existing protocol "X" already suitable for PCP's use case?

(Note: Some materials that may be useful in answering this question are as follows. A 2007 analysis and comparison of NAT control protocols is [Survey of Middlebox Control Protocols](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-eggert-middlebox-control-survey-01) and its presentation in [slides 8-20](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/70/slides/safe-0.pdf). Also see the 2009 [Review of NAT Control Protocols](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brockners-nat-control-protocols-review-00) and [slide 5](http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/74/slides/behave-3.pdf).)

1. UPnP IGD:1 (http://www.upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-WANIPConnection-v1-Service.pdf)
- no support for IPv6
- no support for managing lifetimes of implicit dynamic mappings (PCP "PEER" opcode)
- no mechanism for detecting NAT state loss (PCP "Epoch" time)
- data model assumes host has complete control of the NAT (e.g., client dictates external port number and mapping duration)
- discovery uses multicast, which makes it vulnerable to discovering the wrong NAT gateway (though the same protocol could also be used with a different discovery mechanism)
- XML over TCP is heavy (requesting external IP address takes 42 packets, requesting a port mapping is typically a 14-packet exchange, for a total of 56 packets, compared to 2 packets using PCP) 

2. UPnP IGD:2 (http://upnp.org/specs/gw/UPnP-gw-WANIPConnection-v2-Service.pdf)
- no support for NAT64, NAT46, or NAT66
- no support for managing lifetimes of implicit dynamic mappings (PCP "PEER" opcode)
- no mechanism for detecting NAT state loss (PCP "Epoch" time)(fixed in UPnP Device Architecture 1.1 but which is optional for IGD v2)
- data model assumes host has complete control of the NAT (e.g., client dictates mapping duration)
- To remedy the deficiency of IGD 1, IGD 2 adds the new AddAnyPortMapping operation. Unfortunately the IGD 2 specification also cautions client writers not to depend on it actually working: "AddAnyPortMapping NOTE: Not all NAT implementations will support InternalPort values that are different from ExternalPort." So in principle IGD 2 has this capability, but in reality it's optional whether it actually works on any given device, making it infeasible to make a client that depends on it. (this seems to be a questionable interpretation of the specs: a compliant v2 device is REQUIRED to not restrict port mappings to ExternalPort and InternalPort values being the same, the corresponding error code is defined only for AddPortMapping with a MUST NOT)
- discovery uses multicast, which makes it vulnerable to discovering the wrong NAT gateway (though the same protocol could also be used with a different discovery mechanism)
- XML over TCP is heavy 

3. NAT-PMP (draft-cheshire-nat-pmp)
- no IPv6 support
- no support for managing lifetimes of implicit dynamic mappings (PCP "PEER" opcode)
- assumes the default gateway is the NAT-PMP device
- doesn't provide a lifetime for the public IP address 

4. Diameter NAT Control Application (draft-ietf-dime-nat-control)

5. NSIS NSLP (RFC5973)
- complex 

6. MIDCOM (RFC3304)
- uses SNMP, which requires a library
- intended for service providers to control NATs, not subscribers to control NATs 
    
7.    SOCKS, TCP only, IPv4 only
8.    SOCKSv5 (RFC1928), forces re-writing of packet headers (bad for firewalling), reverse SOCKSv5 proxy not fully specified
9.    ETSI Ia (ETSI ES 283 018)
10.    ETSI Gq' (ETSI TS 183017)
11.    ITU Rs (ITU-T Q.3321)
12.    ITU Rw (ITU-T Q.3303.3, RFC5431)
13.    Diameter Rx+
14.    Diameter Gx+
15.    STUN (RFC5389)
16.    RSIP (RFC3103)
17.    ALD (draft-woodyatt-ald)
18.    NLS (draft-shore-nls-tl)
19.    AFWC (draft-shore-afwc)
