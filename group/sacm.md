# Welcome to the IETF SACM Working Group Wiki 

This is a page for general information about the SACM Working Group that is not represented in published documents. 

## SACM Vulnerability Assessment Scenario 

The SACM Working Group developed the SACM Vulnerability Assessment Scenario draft (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sacm-vuln-scenario/).

In lieu of actual publication, it has been decided to document that information in this wiki to help frame and guide the work of the SACM Working Group. The link to the SACM Vulnerability Assessment Scenario, in this wiki, can be found  [here](/group/sacm/SacmVulnerabilityAssessmentScenario). 

Additionally, SACM participants are planning to participate in the IETF 99 Hackathon. Planning and other related information can be found at the SacmVulnerabilityAssessmentHackathon page.

# SACM Working Group GitHub Usage

Also see the [SacmGitHubIssueStats](/group/sacm/SacmGitHubIssueStats) page for information about how we're doing with issues.
