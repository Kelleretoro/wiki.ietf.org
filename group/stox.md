Welcome to the IETF STOX WG Wiki 
The STOX WG in the RAI area is chartered to discuss and define protocol mappings between SIP and XMPP, that would make it easier for implementers to enable interworking between SIP-based and XMPP-based systems.

Our charter can be found at http://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/stox/charter/.
