### Administrivia
* How do we add EODIR to the IETF Agenda for Plenary Meetings? (Cooley)
	(Currently, the Friday morning EODIR meeting is in a side meeting room, but only advertised internally.  Here is the IETF 123 announcment:  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/eodir/QRYvrpVMg_f49-h5zCH404a46GA/)
  
* How to handle dispatch/secdispatch/witdispatch going forward.  Both dispatch and secdispatch have mailing lists already.  What about wit?  (Cooley)

* [Non-WG List Audit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15qe1kRojQcL6uRE0rMv_f0NvbqeGKwkSccoInXR9CWs/edit?usp=sharing) (Cindy)



### Document Discussions



### Management Issues

* Follow-up of https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/iesg-only/qzDK8a4DwkeS60jGyXjAtu_u_d4/# (Ã‰ric & Eric)

### WG News 

### Documents to Swap 

### Executive Sessions
 * telechat draft (Cooley)


### AOB

Tim Chown asked at the plenary about the costs of a 1 day pass. He was seeking to participate one day on-site because he was a Chair and could travel to his WG meeting and meet others, but unable to attend for the rest of the week this time. Can we explore why this was so costly?

### Parking Lot
Please list topics in this section that could use discussion but may not warrant a meeting on their own. 




### Topics Deferred Till Next Informal 
* For sometime in September: Discuss kramdown-rfc support (was raised at IETF 123 Sunday meeting)
