# Internet Area Directorate (int-dir)

## Purpose

The [Internet Area Directorate](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/intdir/about/) reviewers assist Area Directors, Working Group chairs, and document authors with documents containing INT-related content. The group consists notably of some Working Group Chairs of the INT Area and selected individuals chosen for their technical knowledge in the INT area and their willingness to work with other groups within the IETF

More information about the [Internet Directorate Review Process](IntDirReview).

For a list of the current directorate members, see the [list of revieweres](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/intdir/reviewers/).

The directorate can be contacted by sending e-mail to int-dir@ietf.org.  There is a mailing list [archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/int-dir/).

## What to Look For

The most important item is to give the ADs a sense of how important it is that they pay attention to the document. See also [Internet Area hot topics](https://wiki.ietf.org/group/iesg/int) page for topics that have been repeatedly identified.

## Re-Reviews

Once you have been assigned a document, you are generally expected to stay with that document through completion, even if additional reviewers are assigned.  Accordingly, when a document you've already reviewed is revised or is scheduled for the IESG telechat, the secretary may assign it to you again for a recheck.  These reassignments will be flagged with an "R" in the assignment email.

Look to see if the draft has changed since the last call review and briefly let the ADs know if any identified showstopper problems have been fixed or still remain. Feel free to include your original review, just to make it easier to find. Particularly on these returning items, remember that the datatracker history tab has diffs between versions. Send the re-reviews just like the initial review.

## Early Reviews

The WG chair can request an early review of the document he feels is almost ready (usually after WG LC or similar), just to get early feedback on the document before the IETF LC. The early reviews are in a separate section in the assignment email, and they should be done during the next two weeks or so to be useful for the WG. Their reviews should be sent to the same places as other reviews, but it is very important to include the draftname.all@ietf.org so the reviews go to the WG Chairs. You may also include the WG list if you want, but WG chairs can also forward your reviews there.


## Process 

The secretary is using a datatracker review tool for round-robin assignments. This tool is also available for the reviewers by just logging in to the datatracker, and selecting "My reviews" from the account menu. [My Reviews](https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/review/) page contains a list of assigned documents, and also the list of latest documents the reviewer has reviewed.

The GENART has written a nice and useful [documentation on how to use the datartacker review tool](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/gen/DatatrackerReviewToolHowTo) that is also applicable to int-dir of course.

### Form of review

Each review must include one of the following at the beginning of the review:

* For Early reviews: 
`I am the assigned int-dir reviewer for this draft. For background on int-dir, please see the [FAQ](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/intdir). Please resolve these comments along with any other comments you may receive.`

* For IETF Last Call reviews: 
`I am the assigned int-dir reviewer for this draft.These
comments were written with the intent of improving the Internet area aspects of the IETF drafts. Please treat these comments just like any other last call comments. For background on int-dir, please see the [FAQ](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/intdir).`

* For IESG Evaluation reviews: 
`I am the assigned int-dir reviewer for this draft.  These
comments were written with the intent of improving the Internet area aspects of the IETF drafts. Please wait for direction from your document shepherd or AD before posting a new version of the draft.  For background on int-dir, please see the [FAQ](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/group/intdir).`

### Declining a review

Reasons to decline review include:
* Not this reviewer's particular area of expertise
* Reviewer is not available

After three business days, if a volunteer has been identified that volunteer is directed to begin the review

The directorate chairs may re-assign the document to another volunteer member if the reviews are not performed by the committed date without any valid reason.

## Workload

Normally, each reviewer should each be assigned one new document approximately every two months. Note that one document might easily come up two or more times (e.g., during Early review, then again during IETF last call and when placed on the telechat agenda).

At the end of the [My Reviews](https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/review/) page, there is also an option to edit the settings for the reviewer, i.e., the reviewers can mark themselves being away for a period of time.
