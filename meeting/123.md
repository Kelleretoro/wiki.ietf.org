More information about side meeting can be found at https://trello.com/b/6kmZPwOx/ietf-123-side-meeting-scheduling

## Airport Transportation :airplane:

Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD) is operated by AENA (National Airports Authority), being the biggest one in Spain, 2nd in Europe, and 14th in the world. It has 4 main terminals, which distribute the flights among different airline alliances.

The biggest and most modern terminal, the T4, concentrates all the flights from the Oneworld alliance, and has a Satellite terminal (T4S), for all the non-Schengen flights.

[Official AENA website with all the airport information](http://www.aena.es/en/madrid-barajas-airport/index.html).

The 4 main terminals are interconnected by [free shuttle bus](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/transport-between-terminals.html).

AENA is the national operator for Spanish and many international airports. You can register for free in their [Club](https://clubcliente.aena.es/AenaClub/en/) to obtain free services and discounts within the airports network.

[Alternative non-official information website](https://www.aeropuertomadrid-barajas.com/eng/).

Depending on what terminal you're landing, there are several transport options to reach the venue.

All the public transports in Madrid have air conditioning.

There are different bus lines, metro and train. Google Maps offers very good information of all the choices.

- Metro (recommented, faster & cheaper, unless you prefer a taxi)
- Cercanías (Commuter) Train
- Bus
- Taxi

The most efficient method to reach the IETF venue from the Madrid Airport is by Taxi or rideshare service. If you are looking for a more immersive and cost-effective travel method, you can take the local Metro, Train, or Bus system.

If you plan to use the public transport around Madrid, it is recommended to purchase 10-trips or a Multi Public Transport Card for 30 days, which can be just Metro, Bus, Cercanías Train, or combinations of them, so you can save more as much as you use it. All the information available at the [Metro web site](https://www.metromadrid.es/en).

In addition to that, there is also a Tourist Card with unlimited traveling, and different options depending on the number of days (can be further recharged afterwards), which can be purchased at any of the airport terminals. [Complete Information](https://www.crtm.es/billetes-y-tarifas/otras-tarjetas/turistica/?lang=en).

### Transport Card for Madrid Region

This is very interesting, instead of the Tourist Card or 10-trips, if you plan to commute a lot, or stay more than 7 days. Also for ages up to 14 or over 65 as then you get free access to all the public transport.

You can use the [Virtual Transport Card app](https://www.crtm.es/billetes-y-tarifas/apps/tarjeta-transporte-virtual), either for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=tarjeta%20transporte%20virtual&c=apps) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/tarjeta-transporte/id1619770175), in order to "load" your transport tickets instead of requiring a formal card (waiting for authority confirmation, the formal card may be also required, at least in the case of iOS).

To obtain the formal card, you can make an [appointment](https://webttp.comunidad.madrid/CRTM-ABONOS/entrada_cita.aspx) something like 60-90 minutes after your flight arrival (so you have time for immigration, baggage pick-up, customs, etc., much less if you travel from Schengen area). This [map](https://www.crtm.es/media/m22n41g0/oficinasgestionttp.png) shows all the available offices for making an appointment, including the ones in airport (T2. T4 seems not available at the moment, so you need to take the [free shuttle](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/transport-between-terminals.html#fromterminalt4) to T2). If you land outside the working hours of the airport offices, you will not be able to take advantage of the card for the 1st trip from the airport to the hotel, but still you can make the appointment nearby the venue or your hotel. Next (walking distance) to the venue there are two of them:
- Plaza de Castilla
- Nuevos Ministerios

In case of flight delay and landing then after the office hours in the airport, you can [modify or cancel the appointment](https://webttp.comunidad.madrid/CRTM-ABONOS/modificar_anular.aspx), in this case also you will need to pay this trip to the hotel.

You can also [order online](https://webttp.comunidad.madrid/CRTM-ABONOS/entrada.aspx?s=individual) and use your hotel address, at least 1 week before your arrival. Make sure to include your reservation number as part of the address so the hotel properly identify you when the post arrives. This means you will need to pay for the trip from the airport to the hotel.

### Metro :metro:

The Madrid Airport is connected to the city of Madrid via the [Pink Metro Line 8](https://www.metromadrid.es/en/linea/linea-8). [Alternative map](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/getting-there/underground.html). This line ends at the Nuevos Ministerios Station, where you would need to transfer to the [Dark Blue Metro Line 10](https://www.metromadrid.es/en/linea/linea-10), direction "Hospital Infanta Sofia". The closest station to the Meliá Castilla is "Cuzco" (5 minutes walking to the Melíá Castilla), just 2 stations from Nuevos Ministerios.

The total journey is estimated to be about 40-45 minutes in travel time and will cost 4.50€. Along with your regular single or 10-trip ticket, you have to buy a 3€ airport supplement which can be loaded on the same card.

The airport has two metro stations; one at Terminal 2 (T2), floor 1, and the other one at Terminal 4 (T4), floor -1. Both are part of the pink line 8. These lines run from 06:00 to 01:30.

### Cercanías Train :train:

Madrid Airport is served by the train line C-1 (light blue), located in Aeropuerto Terminal 4 (T4), floor -1. Take the C1 (light blue) line to the Madrid Chamartin Train Station where you will transfer to the Metro dark Blue Line 10 to the venue (direction Puerta del Sur, stop at Cuzco Station).

You can also use at Madrid Chamartin the Metro light Blue Line 1 direction Valdecarros, stop just at the next Station Plaza de Castilla and walk to Meliá Castilla (10 minutes).

Cercanias train tickets are about 2.60€ for a one-way trip and 5.20€ for a return one and can be purchased by the station’s automatic vendors. When buying a ticket, you must use it during the next 2 hours, while the return ticket is valid until next day. Expect about 45 minutes of travel time including transfers.

[Complete information about the Cercanias network](https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/suburban-madrid).

### Bus :bus:

There is a bus service from the airport to Madrid Center, however if you're staying at the Meliá Castilla, is not the best option, even if you will be directly connected to the Metro, or other buses.

Nonetheless, the bus network (EMT) in Madrid is very extensive, and it can be useful specially if you get a Public Transport Card. [Information about the buses](https://www.emtmadrid.es/Bloques-EMT/Aeropuerto.aspx?lang=en-GB). Buses (not Metro) can also be paid directly with cash (up to 5 €) or credit card.

The most complete information of all the coordinated transports is offered by the CRTM [(Consorcio de Transportes de Madrid)](https://www.crtm.es/tu-transporte-publico/?lang=en).

### Taxi & Rideshare :taxi:

Madrid airport taxis are white taxi vehicles, with a red stripe and the city’s emblem on their sides. They are lined up at the airport taxi ranks, no matter the time or day. Each terminal is equipped with two taxi ranks, one at the departures and one at the arrivals level, while passengers are highly advised to hire their cabs exclusively from the official ranks to avoid getting overcharged. 

Madrid taxis are metered. However, the ride from the airport to the Hotel or City Center is set at 35€, even if the transfer takes place during the night or on public holidays. Additionally, luggage isn’t an extra charge. The travel time is about 20-30 minutes, however, could spike up to 40-50 during peak traffic hours. 

Uber, Cabify and Bolt are rideshare services offered in Madrid. The rideshare station at the Madrid Airport is located in the designated passenger pick-up area outside the airport labeled, "VTC/Rideshares.".

No need for any previous registration.

All the airport terminals offer [currency exchange services](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/categories-and-terminals/currency-exchange.html).  Note that exchange rates at currency exchanges and ATMs in most airports are not as good as ATMs at banks in town.

[XE Currency Conversion Website](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=EUR)

The older currency (Peseta) is only accepted for exchange in the [National Bank](https://www.bde.es/bde/en/).

## VAT Refund
Most of the airports in Spain have "electronic kiosk" (DIVA) for requesting tax refunds for non-EU residents, and offices for support in case the validation through the machine could not get achieved.

AENA offers the relevant information for each airport. [Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas airport](https://www.aena.es/en/adolfo-suarez-madrid-barajas/airport-services/categories-and-terminals/vat-refund.html).

## Parks and Gardens
Madrid has many green areas. [Information and map](https://www.esmadrid.com/en/parks-gardens-madrid).

## Safety
In general Spain is safe. Madrid and its extensive public transport are not an exception.

Madrid is a big city, so usual recommendations about pickpockets, especially in busy shopping and tourist areas, apply.

Of course, as in any other big city, there are some more remote suburbs, which I will not recommend to visit.

## Emergency Assistance :ambulance: :cop:
In case of an emergency situation, the emergency number in Spain is **112**.

In addition to that, you have the "SATE" or [Foreign Tourist Assistance Service](https://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/sate).

There is a closer [police station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Ly7UyHVBKZ3r7Usy8) to the Meliá (12m walk).

TAX-FREE SHOPPING

Madrid is a great destination for shopping tourism. Non-EU visitors can also take advantage of the tax refund to save extra money on their travel expenses.

Remember that, to be elegible, you must present your original passport in the shop.

To obtain a tax refund before leaving the country through airport customs, non-EU residents can apply for an early refund by completing the procedures at major shopping centers, at offices in the city center, or even from their smartphone using an [app](https://www.globalblue.com/en/shoppers/mobile-customer-care).

Regardless, as indicated above in the VAT Refund section, visitors must validate their purchases at the airport's DIVA kiosk by presenting the forms provided by the shop.

There are several tax-free operators on the market. [Global Blue](https://www.globalblue.com/en/shoppers/how-to-shop-tax-free/destinations/spain), one of the main international tax-free operators, offers all the methods for early refund options in Madrid and they have multiple [locations in Madrid](https://www.globalblue.com/en/refund-points-map?country=Spain&category=Refunding%20point%20only&unit=km).

## Food recommendations, not to miss while you're in Spain
Included links to recipes, so you can have a look to the ingredients. Please note that there maybe differences depending on each chef, so double check with the restaurant in case you have any dietary restrictions or intolerances.

### Cold Soups
- [Gazpacho](https://spanishsabores.com/recipe-gazpacho-andaluz/#ingredients). Refreshing and only vegetable (mainly tomato). There are unlimited variations with melon, watermelon, strawberry, mango, cherry, roasted vegetables, ...
- [Salmorejo](https://spanishsabores.com/antonias-salmorejo-recipe/). Very similar to gazpacho, however it may have non-vegetable ingredients, such as boiled eggs and iberian ham. There are some variations, for example using [beet](https://spanishsabores.com/cold-beet-soup-recipe-beet-salmorejo/).
- [Ajo Blanco](https://spanishsabores.com/ajo-blanco-recipe-chilled-almond-soup/). Mainly almonds, garlic and bread.

### Warm Soups
You will be able to find many offering for warm soups, not just vegetables, but also fish and seafood soups. A must try is  [Sopa de ajo o sopa Castellana](https://www.bascofinefoods.com/spanish-recipes/sopa-de-ajo/), for instance to recharge your batteries after a night of partying.

### Salads or so ...
Not sure if everybody will considered them as a salad. They can be a dish on their own, or tapas, better order several of them and share!
Some of them can have only vegetables, check with the chef.
Some can be served warm or hot, even as side of a main dish.
- [Ensaladilla rusa](https://spanishsabores.com/ensaladilla-rusa-recipe-russian-potato-salad/). Russian Potato (aka Olivier) Salad. It can have tuna or belly (not just from tuna). Some times they can have also shrimps.
- [Ensalada campera](https://bake-street.com/en/ensalada-campera-country-salad/). Country Salad (potato, tomato, pepper, olives, boiled egg, tuna).
- [Ensalada de alubias](https://www.mediterrasian.com/delicious_recipes_spanish_white_bean_salad.htm). White bean salad (beans, pepper, black olives).
- [Ensalada de judias verdes y patatas](https://www.food.com/recipe/spanish-green-beans-with-potatoes-342589). Mainly green beans and potatoes.
- [Samfaina](https://cookpad.com/eng/recipes/2615298). Commonly served with fried eggs. Mainly peppers, aubergine and tomatoes.
- [Pisto](https://spanishsabores.com/traditional-spanish-pisto-recipe/). Commonly served with fried eggs as well. Similar to the previous one, adding zucchini.
- [Escalivada](https://www.carolinescooking.com/escalivada-catalan-roasted-vegetables/). Roasted vegetables such as aubergine, pepper, onion, tomato, ...
- [Patatas bravas](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/the-ultimate-patatas-bravas). Potatoes with a spicy sauce. So many variations of the recipe, almost every restaurant, bar or chef has its own!
- [Patatas alioli](https://spanishsabores.com/patatas-alioli-recipe/). Potatos with a garlic mayo.
- [Tumbet](https://spanishsabores.com/mallorcan-tumbet-recipe/). Peppers, zucchini, aubergine, onion and tomato sauce.

### Paella, Rice, others
Instead of [paella](https://spanishsabores.com/what-is-paella/) I prefer to talk about "spanish rice (arroz) dishes" as there are many versions or the paella. Note that a good rice dish, may require up to 40 minutes cooking. My recommendation is to try:
- [Arroz negro (black rice)](https://spanishsabores.com/black-paella-recipe/). Mainly rice, squid (including a small portion of its ink) and prawns. A must to have it with "all i oli" (Garlic and Oil mayonnaise, no egg).
- [Paella del senyoret](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/arroz-senoret). All the shellfish is peeled so you avoid getting your hands dirty.
- [Arroz abanda](https://spainonafork.com/spanish-seafood-rice-arroz-a-banda-recipe/). Seafood and fish rice with the seafood and fish served on the side.
- [Arroz meloso](https://spanishsabores.com/seafood-rice-recipe/). This rice is similar to a paella but a bit soupy.

If instead of rice you prefer pasta, try the [fideuá](https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes/how-to-make-fideua). Similar cookings as the rice dishes, replacing the rice with cut vermicelli.

### Meat
In Spain there is a big variety of high quality meat and all kind of preparations, some of them are specialities from different regions. You will find beef, pork, lamb, poultry and game meats in most of the restaurants.

### Fish and Sea Food
Similarly, commonly available high quality fish are tuna, cod, seabass, turbot, monkfish, hake and sole. As in the case of the meat, there are many specialities in each Spanish region.

Tuna from the south of Spain, captured using ancient techniques [Almadraba](https://genuineandalusia.com/almadraba-barbate-red-tuna-spain/) is especially appreciated (whether raw or cooked recipes). A very common preparation is [mojama](https://www.anchoasdeluxe.com/en/blog/1078_the-3-best-tapas-recipes-with-mojama-from-barbate-the-taste-of-the-sea-on-your-palate.html), which basically is wind dryed salted tuna.

You could also try fish roe, from different fish varieties and cookings, even in [salads](https://www.conservasortiz.com/en/recipes/hake-roe-salad/).

### Tapas, pintxos or complete dishes?
