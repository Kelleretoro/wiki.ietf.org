The airline is responsible for delivering your luggage. For missing or damaged luggage, or any other related issue, you need to go to your airline‚Äôs luggage service counter, located just before the luggage claim exit.

**Handing in your declaration card**

Before exiting to the public area, you need to present your declaration card to a Canada Border Services Agency officer, who will advise you if you need to undergo a secondary inspection. This consists of a manual luggage inspection and, in some cases, a search.

In Montr√©al, like the rest of Canada, tipping is customary in restaurants, bars, and taxis, with 15% of the pre-tax bill considered standard for restaurants (20% for an excellent service).

**Maple Syrup**

If you plan on buying maple syrup, avoid the glass bottles sold in most souvenir shops. They are more expensive, smaller and usually only of the amber variety. All maple syrup (of each variety) **is exactly the same**, regardless of whether it's stored in a fancy container or a generic metal can.

You should instead look for **540ml** maple syrup metal cans, found in almost all grocery stores. They are usually available in either **Amber / Ambr√©** (lighter) or **Dark / Fonc√©** (stronger) variety, although it's possible to find **Golden / Dor√©** (very light) and **Very Dark / Tr√®s fonc√©** (very strong). If this is your first time buying maple syrup, the **Dark / Fonc√©** variant is a good choice.

They are usually sold around $10 or less.

![Maple Syrup Cans](/meeting/ca-montreal/mtl-maple-syrup-cans.png)

> Unopened cans can be stored indefinitely in the pantry / at room temperature. However, once opened, you **MUST** transfer its content into a glass / plastic container and keep it refrigerated. It should then preferably be consumed within a year.
