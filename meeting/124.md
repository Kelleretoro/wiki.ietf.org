### Taxi & Rideshare :taxi:
Taxis to and from the IETF Meeting Venue have a fixed rate, depending on the time of day:

- Between 5 a.m. and 11 p.m.: **$49.45**
- Between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.: **$56.70**

Payment in cash, by debit card or with VISA / MasterCard credit card.

**Rideshare**

Both Uber and Lyft are available in Montréal. Use the app to schedule a pickup.

From Baggage Claim, exit Door 20 or Door 28 on the Arrivals level.

### Passenger Pickup :car:

While you wait for your passenger to exit the airport, you can park for free at one of the three CellParc lots for up to (2) hours.

When your passenger is ready to be picked up, ask them to tell you which zone they’re waiting in (A, B, C, D, or E). You can then proceed to the arrivals drop-off and pickup area and pull over in the appropriate zone to pick up your passenger.

### Immigration, Baggage Reclaim and Customs

You can complete your customs and immigration declaration even before you get to YUL. Advance Declaration, which is available on the ArriveCAN application ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/arrivecan/id1505394667) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.gc.cbsa.coronavirus&hl=en)) and offered by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), allows you to fill out your declaration up to 72 hours before your flight, saving you time as you leave the airport.

Once you’ve passed the mandatory inspection, you can collect your checked luggage.

**Baggage claim**

Check the display boards to find out which baggage carousel number has been assigned to your flight. Luggage carts are available in this area if you need one. You can also ask a luggage porter to help you.

The airline is responsible for delivering your luggage. For missing or damaged luggage, or any other related issue, you need to go to your airline’s luggage service counter, located just before the luggage claim exit.

**Handing in your declaration card**

Before exiting to the public area, you need to present your declaration card to a Canada Border Services Agency officer, who will advise you if you need to undergo a secondary inspection. This consists of a manual luggage inspection and, in some cases, a search.

**Late or lost luggage**

The luggage claim service counter is located on the international arrivals level, at the end of the corridor, in front of gate 28. Use one of the telephones to speak to an attendant and get information about retrieving your luggage.

In Canada, prices shown for products / services do not include the sales tax. The sales tax is **14.975%** (QST 9.975% + GST 5%) of the advertised price.

However, some products are exempt like basic groceries (meats, fish, cereals, dairy products, eggs, vegetables, coffee and tea), products for infants, feminine hygiene products and books / audiobooks.

## Tipping Culture

In Montréal, like the rest of Canada, tipping is customary in restaurants, bars, and taxis, with 15% of the pre-tax bill considered standard for restaurants (20% for an excellent service). Note that since May 7th, 2025, a new law states that suggested tip amounts on payment terminals must be calculated **before taxes**, presented in a neutral and uniform manner, and must allow a custom amount to be entered.

However, you are **NOT** expected to tip for take-out restaurants (e.g. fast food) / any restaurant where you stand in line and order at the counter to receive your food. Many of these restaurants will still present a tipping screen on the payment terminal even when there's no table service, in which case you should select None or enter 0.

### Maple Syrup

If you plan on buying maple syrup, avoid the glass bottles sold in most souvenir shops. They are more expensive, smaller and usually only of the amber variety. All maple syrup (of each variety) **is exactly the same**, regardless of whether it's offered in a fancy container or a generic metal can.

You should instead look for **540ml** maple syrup metal cans, found in almost all [grocery / supermarket stores](#groceries-food-markets). They are usually available in either **Amber / Ambré** (lighter) or **Dark / Foncé** (stronger) variety, although it's possible to find **Golden / Doré** (very light) and **Very Dark / Très foncé** (very strong). If this is your first time buying maple syrup, the **Dark / Foncé** variant is a good choice.

They are usually sold around $10 or less.

![Maple Syrup Cans](/meeting/ca-montreal/mtl-maple-syrup-cans.png)

> Unopened cans can be stored indefinitely in the pantry / at room temperature.
> However, once opened, you **MUST** transfer its content into a glass / plastic container and keep it refrigerated. It should then preferably be consumed within a year.
